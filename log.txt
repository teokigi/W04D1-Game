code game logic
code controller
code browser route
check browser works


-Create a Simple Sinatra App to allow the user to play, rock, paper, scissors in their browser.
    - You should be able to go to /rock/scissors and return the string "rock wins" to the page, for example.

    - You will need to write a bit of logic that compares the two hands and decides which one haswon, and then use that in the route definition

    - Next, create a models directory for your game logic class.
Extensions:
    - Add an ERB view file for returning the result of the game, rather than just sending a string.
    - Add a welcome page(and a route to get it) to explain the rules before the user picks their move. Add a link to this on the result view.
    - Add some CSS to either/both of your pages.
Further extension:
    - Think about how you might differentiate between the two people playing the game - currently we don't know who has won, just which hand.(done)
